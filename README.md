# AdvTrains Freight Train Pack

advtrains_freight_train is a mod that adds 4 more types of freight wagons to the
game as well as a slower diesel locomotive. All of the wagons and the locomotive
are recoverable - they drop themselves instead of steel. The recoverability and
slow speed of the locomotive have earned it the nickname of "shunter".

The wagons also have a higher capacity of 48 compared to the standard 24
inventory slots. However, their speed limit is also slower, being only 10 m/s
(36 km/h).
